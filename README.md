# Vehicle Builder

## Description
I had to update the TypeScript application to include additional options for motorized vehicles, such as bikes and trucks. When starting the application, users can either create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle to perform certain actions. If the users decides to create a new vehicle, the application will first promt data, allowing them to input their desired motorized vehicle. Then the user is able to perform certain actions. If the users selects an existing vehicle, they can perform actions with a vehicle. The outcome of the users input will display on the command-line until they decide to exit the application
